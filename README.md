Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.
It is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center ([BVLC](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu)) and community contributors.

# PFF Caffe
**This is an experimentalã€€branch maintained by Jingjing Zhu (@xuanmo0213). It is still in progress.**

This fork is dedicated to provide a common platform for all pff caffe programs, including arm platform support, memory optimization, and custom layers.

## Building
Build procedure is basically the same as on bvlc-caffe-master branch. Here are some steps to follow:

### Prerequisites
This caffe is supported on Linux distributions that use gcc with c++11 support.

Some general dependencies can be installed by following command.
```
sudo apt-get install libprotobuf-dev libleveldb-dev libsnappy-dev libopencv-dev libhdf5-serial-dev protobuf-compiler
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends libboost-all-dev
sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev libtcmalloc_minimal4
```

*CUDA*: The package is default to compile with CUDA. Install the NVIDIA package manually. A NVIDIA developer account is needed to access.
If you want to compile with CUDA support, install
- [NVIDIA CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) 8.0 suggested
- [NVIDIA cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) version according to CUDA installed

*BLAS*: install ATLAS by `sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev` or install OpenBLAS by `sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev` or MKL for better CPU performance. The default build is with OpenBLAS, change Makefile.config if you want to build with ATLAS.

*Python (optional)*: if you use the default Python you will need to `sudo apt-get install the python-dev package` to have the Python headers for building the pycaffe interface.

### Installing the caffe
A default Makefile.config already included for suggested building dependencies.

To build the caffe, simple running
```
make -j8
```
### Running the tests
If a runtest is preferred, simple run
```
make runtest
```
